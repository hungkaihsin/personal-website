- **Actuator Materials**: 

The research focuses on actuators capable of converting external stimuli into kinetic energy. Common materials include Graphene Oxide (GO), Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and Iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4)

- **Bilayer Actuator Development**: 

In 2018, Wen Wang et al. developed a bilayer actuator using GO/PDMS. This actuator responds to stimuli like light, electricity, or other external triggers by undergoing changes or bending.

- **Properties of Materials**: 

GO offers flexible controllability and suitability for composite materials and functional applications. Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) is advantageous for electronic devices, energy storage, and optoelectronic applications. PDMS is transparent, biocompatible, elastic, hydrophobic, and low-cost.

- **Ionic Liquids**: 

Ionic liquids have multifunctional dissolution capabilities, low volatility, high thermal stability, good conductivity, and are relatively harmless. They find extensive applications in material science.

- **Cellulose**: 

Cellulose, a green biomass material, is lightweight, low-cost, and mechanically deformable, making it suitable for actuator applications.

- **Polypyrrole (Ppy)**: 

Ppy has excellent heat absorption and conductivity properties, contributing to actuator performance.

- **Research Objective**: 

The study aims to enhance actuator performance by incorporating ionic liquid into PDMS and combining Cellulose with Ppy + CNFs to create bilayer structured actuators responsive to stimuli like light, humidity, and electricity.
